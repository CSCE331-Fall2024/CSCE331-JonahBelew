    <div class="S_Desc">
        Becoming an Eagle Scout taught me a lot about leadership, communication, and dedication. After meeting with my school’s headmaster, we decided that building a gaga ball pit for the elementary school would be the best choice for my project. A lot of preparation work was required before the day of the project, so during that time I organized the project day’s schedule and contacted people in order to get all of the supplies I needed. I had my dad help me transport all of the wood, tools, and the brackets to my high school where the project would be built. On the day of the project, I demonstrated how to use all of the tools required to those helping me. If they ever needed help, I would assist them and make sure they were on the right track. 
        <br> <br>
        The project took two days to finish, the first day was dedicated to sanding, drilling and staining the wooden planks I had purchased. The second day was dedicated to putting all of the pieces together and completing the project. We had to transfer the wood from where it was drying overnight to the turf by the playground. Then we connected the wood to the metal brackets with nuts and bolts. After a quick stability and resilience check the project was complete, and the satisfaction I felt when it was complete was immeasurable.
        <br> <br>
        After the project was built all I had left was to wrap up a few merit badges and fill out paperwork relating to my project. I had to total up all of the money and time spent building the project, and report it to the Scout leader. Once all of that was completed I celebrated my Court of Honor with my parents, and my friends who helped me build my project. The experience is one I will never forget, and now I get to keep the Eagle Scout title for the rest of my life.
